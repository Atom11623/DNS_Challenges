        "\n",
        "Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Detecting heart disease in its early stages is crucial for enhancing patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease based on various patient features.\n",

        "The main steps involved in this project include:\n",
        "- Data preprocessing and cleaning\n",
        "- Handling class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE\n",
        "- Building and training machine learning models\n",
        "- Evaluating model performance on a validation set\n",
        "- Making predictions on the test dataset\n",

        "- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results\n",
        "- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved\n",
        "- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n",
        "- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n",
        "- **slope**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
        "- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy\n",
